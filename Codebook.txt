This codebook is an updated version of the original readme.txt file provided with the original dataset. 

==========
Background informations (from the original readme file)
==========
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Data transformation
==========
The dataset 'FinalDataset.txt' has been modified from the original dataset available at 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'. 
The script 'run_analysis.R' was run to transform the original dataset into a tidy dataset 'FinalDataset.txt'. The script performs the following steps: 
0. if the original dataset is not found in the working directory, it will be automatically downloaded and unzipped. 
1. the script creates a single data frame from the data containing subject id (subject_*.txt), activity (y_*.txt) and 561 features (X_*.txt), where * is either 'train' or 'test'. This is done for both the 'train' and 'test' datasets. The two resulting dataframes are then merged to regroup 'train' and 'test' into a single dataframe. 
2. the script reads the name of the 561 features in 'features.txt' and uses this to add the variable names. 
3. the script replaces the number corresponding to the different activities with the activity full name found in the 'activity_labels.txt' file. 
4. The script keeps only the column for mean and standard deviation of the measured parameters. 
5. The script renames the variables to replace abbreviations with full names in lowercases and separated by a '.'. 
6. The script aggregates the data to present the mean of each variables for each subject and activity. 
7. The script saves the resulting dataframe in a text file named 'FinalDataset.txt'. 

The FinalDataset.txt contains 180 observations of 68 variables. It is a tab separated file with a header.

Variables description
==========
subject.id : the subject identification number ranging from 1 to 30. 
activity : the type of activity performed. The activities are: "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS" and "WALKING_UPSTAIRS". 

The other 66 feature names contain the following informations: 
time / frequency : time indicates time domain signals captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz, and filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Frequency indicates frequency domain signals, produced by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of these signals. 
body / gravity: the acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
acceleration / gyroscope : indicate data from the acceleremoter or gyroscope respectively. 
jerk: the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. 
magnitude: the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 
X / Y / Z : used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
mean / standard.deviation: indicate the mean value and standard deviation respectively.
